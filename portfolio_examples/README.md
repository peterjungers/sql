# SQL Portfolio
The SQL code presented here is a sample of what I wrote for my introductory and advanced SQL courses, where we learned to work in both Microsoft and Oracle environments. The directories above are listed chronologically.

Along with a prompt of what information we were to present in a query, we were sometimes given an example of what the data would look like for a correctly written query. This was most commonly done in the introductory SQL course. I included all prompts and example data in the code above.
