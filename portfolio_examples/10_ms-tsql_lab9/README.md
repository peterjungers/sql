# Transact SQL
### Re-writing Lab 7

The final week of my advanced SQL course was devoted to learning programming in T-SQL. The assignment was to write a version of the PL/SQL program we had written in Lab 7, containing procedures and triggers. The program runs from the final procedure written in Lab9.sql: Lab9proc.

We were required to write tests within our script for each procedure or trigger. The Lab9Grading.sql script was written by the instructor as a way to grade our Lab9.sql script. It was provided to students during the assignment to help us test.
